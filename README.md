## rate_limit

A simple [package](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68250956/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-crate-and-a-package) containing a single library crate used to rate-limit endpoints on an Actix-Web server. 

**This is my first go at writing library crates and I do not reccomend using this in production**.

This is also a work in progress and in time I will update this repository to adhere to the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html).
